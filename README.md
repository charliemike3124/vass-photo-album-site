# -VUE-PROJECT-TEMPLATE

This is the template I use for my Vue.Js projects. It contains my most commonly used tools and folder structure. 

After cloning, make sure to get every dependency with npm **(npm install)**.
#
**Firebase**

This project contains some examples of firebase services. If you want to add Firebase to your project, make sure to include a **firebase.secret.js** 
in your src folder that exports your App's credentials.
